CAUTION: Binaries in these directories are NOT assured to be up-to-date
with respect to the source code!

One can compare binary timestamps with the timestamps on the ../src/*.[ch]
files to get a clue as to whether the binaries are *likely* to be current.

Running pwalk with no arguments will cause pwalk to produce a 'usage' blurb
which will indicate the binary version -- but that is not a 100% assurance
that the binary was built with the very latest vesion of the code.
